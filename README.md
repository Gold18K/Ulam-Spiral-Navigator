The bottom left of the window allows you to choose a set of coordinates you wish to visit.

The bottom right of the window allow you to choose:
- The side length of the section a single Worker is allowed to compute at a time (Default value: 150);
- The number of cores the site is allowed to use to compute the spiral (Default value: The number of cores of your CPU minus one);
- The number of cycles the Miller Rabin algorithm must use to check for primality (Default value: 6);

The top right of the window allows you to download the generated portion of the Ulam Spiral as a .png file;

Clicking one of the pixels will let you copy to clipboard the informations about that particular pixel!
